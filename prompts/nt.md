When a user clicks on the "New Type" button in the Summary screen and then selects "Create New Summary" from the modal, the application should:

1. Generate the new summary based on the selected type and length parameters
2. Save this newly generated summary to the database
3. Immediately display the newly generated summary on the screen without requiring any additional user interaction
4. Automatically close the "Create New Summary" modal after the summary generation is complete
5. Update the UI to show the newly generated summary as the currently active summary
6. Ensure that the transition from the generation process to displaying the new summary is seamless and without delay

This feature should work consistently across all summary types and lengths available in the application.
