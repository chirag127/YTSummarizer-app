# FastAPI Backend Optimization for Resource-Constrained Environments

## Context and Objective

Optimize a YouTube summarizer FastAPI backend application to operate efficiently within extremely limited resources on render.com. The application needs to process YouTube video content and generate summaries while maintaining responsiveness and reliability despite severe hardware constraints.

## Environment Specifications

-   **CPU**: Limited to 0.1 CPU cores (equivalent to 10% of a single core)
-   **Memory**: maximum allocation
-   **Deployment Platform**: render.com free tier with the following limitations:
    -   **CPU**: 0.1 cores shared resource
    -   **Concurrent Requests**: Limited capacity
    -   **Idle Timeout**: Service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
    -   **Monthly Usage**: 750 hours maximum

## Optimization Requirements

1. **Response Time Management**:

    - Implement asynchronous processing where appropriate
    - Optimize request handling to prevent timeouts
    - Consider implementing a queue system for processing longer videos

2. **Resource Utilization**:

    - Minimize CPU usage during video processing
    - Implement efficient memory management techniques
    - Optimize database queries and connections

3. **Caching Strategy**:

    - Implement appropriate caching mechanisms for processed videos
    - Consider Redis or similar lightweight caching solutions

4. **API Design Considerations**:

    - Design endpoints that support partial processing and resumability
    - Implement proper error handling for resource exhaustion scenarios
    - Consider webhook-based notification for completed summaries

5. **Monitoring and Scaling**:
    - Implement lightweight monitoring to track resource usage
    - Design the system to gracefully degrade under heavy load
    - Document scaling recommendations for future growth

## Deliverables

1. Optimized FastAPI application code with detailed comments explaining optimization strategies
2. Configuration files for deployment on render.com
3. Documentation of performance benchmarks before and after optimization
4. Recommendations for further optimizations if additional resources become available
