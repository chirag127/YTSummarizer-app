Missing or Incomplete Requirements
RAG Implementation for Long Transcripts: The PRD specifies that RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) should be implemented for handling long transcripts, but I couldn't find explicit evidence of this in the codebase. The current implementation appears to pass the entire transcript to the Gemini model, which may not work well for very long videos.
Token Management: While the conversation history is maintained and passed to the Gemini model, there doesn't appear to be explicit token counting or management to ensure the context window isn't exceeded.
Recommendations
Implement RAG for Long Transcripts: Add a module that:
Chunks the transcript into smaller segments
Creates embeddings for each chunk
Performs similarity search between the user's question and transcript chunks
Sends only the most relevant chunks to the Gemini model
Add Token Management: Implement a token counting mechanism to:
Track token usage in conversation history
Truncate or summarize older messages when approaching token limits
Ensure the model's context window is never exceeded
Add Analytics Tracking: While there's some analytics tracking in the code, it would be beneficial to implement all the analytics requirements mentioned in the PRD section 8.
Conclusion
The YTSummarizer app has implemented most of the requirements specified in the PRD for the AI-Powered Video Content Q&A feature. The frontend provides a clean, intuitive chat interface, and the backend handles transcript retrieval, conversation history, and AI responses effectively.

The main areas that need attention are:

Implementation of RAG for handling long transcripts
Token management for conversation history
Comprehensive analytics tracking
These improvements would enhance the robustness and scalability of the Q&A feature, particularly for longer videos with extensive transcripts.
