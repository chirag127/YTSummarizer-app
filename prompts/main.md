# FastAPI Backend Optimization for Resource-Constrained Environments

## Context and Objective
Optimize our YouTube summarizer FastAPI backend application to operate efficiently within extremely limited computing resources. The application needs to process YouTube video transcripts and generate summaries while maintaining responsiveness and reliability despite severe hardware constraints.

## Environment Specifications
- **CPU**: Limited to 0.1 CPU cores (equivalent to 10% of a single core)
- **Deployment**: Running in a containerized environment with strict resource quotas

## Optimization Requirements
1. **Response Time**: Maintain API response times under 5 seconds for summary generation requests
2. **Concurrency**: Support at least 5 simultaneous user requests
3. **Resource Usage**: Keep CPU usage below allocated limit and prevent memory leaks
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for resource exhaustion scenarios
5. **Caching**: Implement efficient caching strategies to reduce redundant processing
6. **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilize FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities effectively
7. **Database Optimization**: Optimize database queries and connection pooling
8. **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies and their resource footprint

## Deliverables
1. Optimized FastAPI application code with detailed comments explaining optimization strategies
2. Performance benchmarking results comparing before and after optimization
3. Documentation of all implemented optimization techniques
4. Recommendations for further improvements if additional resources become available
