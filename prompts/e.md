Potential Enhancements for YouTube Summarizer
1. User Authentication and Profiles
Your app currently has settings for API keys but lacks a full user authentication system. Implementing this would enable:

User accounts with secure login/registration
Cross-device synchronization of summaries, favorites, and settings
Social login options (Google, Apple) for easier onboarding
Profile customization with user preferences
Implementation approach:

Use Expo's authentication modules with a service like Firebase Auth, Supabase, or Auth0
Implement secure token storage with expo-secure-store
Create user profile screens and backend endpoints
2. Advanced Summary Features
While your app already has Q&A functionality, you could enhance it with:

Summary comparison to compare different videos on similar topics
Custom summary templates allowing users to save preferred summary formats
Batch processing to summarize multiple videos at once
Summary sharing improvements with better formatting options for social media
Summary categories/tags to organize summaries by topic, generate the tags automatically based on video content, and allow users to filter by tags , the tags should be stored in the database and associated with each summary entry. the tags should be generated when generating the summary by using the gemini model to analyze the video content and extract relevant keywords or phrases that represent the main topics of the video. This will help users easily find and categorize their summaries based on specific themes or subjects.Store tags in the database associated with each summary
Display tags on the summary screen
Allow filtering by tags in the history screen
Support offline functionality for tags (e.g., local storage of tags) and summaries
3. Enhanced Text-to-Speech
Your TTS implementation could be improved with:

More voice options including different accents and languages
Voice customization settings for more natural-sounding speech
Background audio controls in notification center for all platforms
Audio export to save summaries as MP3 files
Speed control presets for quick switching between speeds
4. Advanced Offline Capabilities
While you have some offline functionality, you could enhance it with:

Smarter caching strategies with prioritization of frequently accessed content
Background sync that intelligently syncs when conditions are optimal
Offline summary generation using a lightweight on-device model for basic summaries
Download manager for users to explicitly save videos for offline access
Storage management tools to help users manage cached content
5. UI/UX Improvements
Dark mode support with automatic switching based on system settings
Customizable themes with color options
Improved accessibility features (larger text options, screen reader support)
Gesture-based navigation for easier one-handed use
Interactive tutorials for new users
Redesigned history view with better filtering and sorting options
6. Performance Optimizations
Lazy loading and virtualization for history lists to improve performance with large datasets
Image optimization to reduce bandwidth usage
Code splitting for web version to improve initial load time
Memory usage optimization especially for handling long transcripts
Battery usage optimization for mobile devices
7. Analytics and Insights

White-label solution for businesses
Implementation Priority Recommendations
Based on user value and implementation complexity, I recommend prioritizing:

User Authentication System - This enables many other features and improves user retention
Dark Mode & UI Improvements - Relatively easy to implement with high user satisfaction
Enhanced TTS Features - Building on existing functionality with high utility
Advanced Offline Capabilities - Critical for mobile users with connectivity issues
Multi-language Support - Expands your potential user base significantly
