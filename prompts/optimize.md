Optimize the FastAPI backend application for resource-constrained environments with approximately 0.1 CPU cores and 512MB RAM. Specifically:

1. Implement memory optimization techniques to keep the application within the 512MB RAM limit
2. Reduce CPU usage through efficient request handling and processing
3. Configure appropriate worker settings for the ASGI server (Uvicorn/Gunicorn)
4. Implement proper connection pooling for any database interactions
5. Add caching mechanisms where appropriate to reduce computational load
6. Optimize any heavy computational operations or data processing
7. Configure proper timeouts and connection limits
8. Implement request throttling or rate limiting if necessary
9. Provide specific configuration settings that should be applied
10. Include performance testing methodology to verify the optimizations work within the specified resource constraints

Please analyze the current FastAPI implementation and provide specific code changes with explanations for each optimization.
